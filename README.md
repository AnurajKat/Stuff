# Stuff

As of 16-05-2022 it has 2 working modules.
I'll aim to make them as modular as possible per my capacity.
 
 - Stuff-Api-Doc
 - Stuff-SpringBoot

## Stuff-Api-Doc
It meant to be used as a Api Specification and generates Server Stub Codegen from the specifications to be later used by the Stuff-SpringBoot

## Stuff-SpringBoor
Implements the API specifications.

# TODO
- Make Useless API somewhat useful or create some useful api
- Template module for HTML pages and probably pdfs
- Module to generate Docker images of the Service
- Database integration????
- Authentication stuff
  - sessions and stuff
  - possibly with usage of jwt
